                        technology and all things software. My programming knowledge pertains
                        to that of mostly back-end languages such as: Python, Java, Kotlin and
                        C++. I also have a fair amount of knowledge of front-end languages
                        such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as frameworks such as React and
                        Vuejs.
